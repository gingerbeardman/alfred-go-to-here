# Go To Here - Alfred workflow

Quickly switch the selected path in a MacOS Open/Save dialog based on an Alfred selection.

## Setup

Optionally populate the List Filter with default/favorite paths.

Use "Configure Workflow..." to:

- edit keywords
- adjust the text of "Open" (default: `Open`) and "Save" (default: `Save`) dialog buttons to match your system's language settings (case sensitive)
- depending on the speed of your system, adjust the delay value (in milliseconds, default `250`) used between some actions

## Usage

With an Open/Save dialog active, invoke the workflow with one of the methods for selecting a file or folder path.

The Open/Save dialog should now have switched to the selected folder or file path.
