# Go To Here - Alfred workflow

Quickly switch the selected path in a MacOS Open/Save dialog based on an Alfred selection.

## Setup

Optionally populate the List Filter with default/favorite paths.

Use "Configure Workflow..." to:

- edit keywords
- If needed, adjust the name of "Open" dialog windows to match your system's language settings. This value is case sensitive. Default: `Open`.

## Usage

With an Open/Save dialog active, invoke the workflow with one of the methods for selecting a file or folder path.

The Open/Save dialog should now have switched to the selected folder or file path.
